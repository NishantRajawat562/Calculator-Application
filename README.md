# 🧮 Calculator Application Using Method Overloading
 
---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a simple *Calculator Application* built in Java to demonstrate the concept of *Method Overloading*.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as *Addition, **Subtraction, **Multiplication, and **Division* with multiple parameter types.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply *method overloading* in Java.  
- Use *control structures* and *I/O operations* effectively.  
- Learn to handle *basic input validation*.  
- Gain experience in *menu-driven program design*.
